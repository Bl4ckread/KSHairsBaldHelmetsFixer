    "OneLineDescription": "Fixes bald heads under helmets when using KS Hairdos",
    "LongDescription": "When using KS Hairs with many vanilla helmets, the character's head may appear completely bald underneath. This is because many of the helmets use the biped slot 41 - LongHair, which blocks out the hairline from showing. This patcher removes the biped slot from all the helmet records, allowing the hairline to show again. Obviously it's not as good as a proper hair model, but it's better than nothing.\nEditorIDs for items you do not wish to modify can be added to the blacklist in the settings. The blacklist is a comma separated string of EditorIDs. The items on the list are partially matched, case-insensitive. E.g., if you want to blacklist all KS SMP wigs, you can add 'kswig' (without quotes) to the blacklist.",
